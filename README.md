# CarrotQuest

CarrotQuest is a simple arcade-style game I built with Pygame for my students in my CS course on Introduction to Programming in Python. You control a rabbit that moves left and right to catch falling carrots. Every carrot you catch increases your score. The game includes basic collision detection, sound effects, and animated sprites.
